### GET /me

| | |
|---|---|
| Auth | `Bearer` (Sanctum) |
| Headers | `X-Freelancer-Id` (optional), `X-Client-Id` (optional) |
| Middleware | `auth:sanctum` |

Returns [MeResource](../schemas/membership.md#meresource) with the authenticated user, freelancer memberships, active workspace, subscription summary, client memberships, and active client organization.

When `X-Freelancer-Id` is omitted and the user belongs to exactly one workspace, that workspace is used for `active_freelancer` and `subscription`. When the user belongs to multiple workspaces and no header is sent, those fields are `null`.

When `X-Client-Id` is omitted and the user belongs to exactly one client organization, that client is used for `active_client`. When the user belongs to multiple client organizations and no header is sent, `active_client` is `null`.

**Response `200`**
